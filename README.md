# GIT TIPS

- git status: show current status of repo
- git add: add files to be commited
- git commit -m 'message here ': commit changes with meaningful message

## to add github repo

- create new repo on github

# Basic workflow

--------------------------- repeat this often ---------------

- try to break up problems into simplier problems (maybe this on paper, or comments in code, or rubber ducky method)
- code one these broken up problems
- test and make sure that chunk is complete
- git add (files that you changed related chunk of work)
- git commit -m 'message describes that chunck of work'
- repeat
